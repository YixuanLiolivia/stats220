## Import data
```{r}
logged_data <- ("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSslnld5QFQj1P3Ch4yb_UQ9FJnWuHFIQWCN55V9FUmcTsdWNCobYL4RMdWbtvSfOWTnyaPNKij6R55/pub?gid=469008883&single=true&output=csv")
latest_data <- read_csv(logged_data) %>%
  rename(main_product_category=2, 
         relevant_rate=4)
names(latest_data)
glimpse(latest_data)
```

## execute data about how many ads did you see during a 5-minute scroll?
```{r}
min(latest_data$`How many ads did you see during a 5-minute scroll?`)
max(latest_data$`How many ads did you see during a 5-minute scroll?`)
mean(latest_data$`How many ads did you see during a 5-minute scroll?`)
length(latest_data$Number)
summary(latest_data)
```

## draw the two plots
```{r}
ggplot(data = latest_data, aes(x = main_product_category, fill = main_product_category)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "What was the main product category of the ad?", 
       x = "Category", 
       y = "Number of people")

paste("Out of", length(latest_data$main_product_category), "people, the most accepted common ad category was", max(latest_data$main_product_category), ".")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = latest_data, aes(x = relevant_rate, fill = relevant_rate)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Rate how relevant the ad felt to 20 people?",
       x = "Relevant Rate", 
       y = "Number of people")

paste("Among the 20 people, the average relevance rating was", round(mean(latest_data$relevant_rate)), "and the most common rating was", names(which.max(table(latest_data$relevant_rate))), ".")
```


```{r}
pets <- c("cat", "dog", "turtle", "rabbit")
best_pet <- pets[1]

```

The best pet to have is a `r best_pet` of course!
